ðŸŒ© Connect Four Game â€“ C# Project

Overview:This Connect Four game is a C# implementation of the classic two-player board game. It was built to showcase object-oriented programming, logic structuring, and GUI development skills using Windows Forms. The primary objective of the game is for two players to take turns dropping discs into a grid, with the goal of being the first to connect four of their discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Gameplay:The game uses a standard 7-column, 6-row grid. Each player drops colored discs into a column, and the disc settles at the lowest unoccupied position. The game continuously checks for win conditions after each turn. If no player connects four and the grid is filled, the game ends in a draw.

Features:

Two-Player Mode: Supports local multiplayer turns

Win and Draw Detection: Built-in logic to check for all winning possibilities and draw conditions

Interactive UI: Developed with Windows Forms, enabling mouse-click-based disc dropping and real-time game grid updates

Game Reset Option: A restart button allows players to start a new game without relaunching the application
