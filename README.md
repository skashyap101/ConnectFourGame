ðŸŒ© Connect Four Game â€“ C# Project

Overview:This Connect Four game is a C# implementation of the classic two-player board game. The project was developed to demonstrate knowledge of C# programming, object-oriented design, and GUI development using Windows Forms (or Console, if applicable). The goal of the game is to provide a fun, interactive way for two players to compete by connecting four discs of the same color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Gameplay:The game is played on a 7-column, 6-row grid. Players take turns dropping colored discs into the columns. The disc falls to the lowest available space within the column. The first player to form a line of four of their discs wins. If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Features:

Two-Player Mode: Players alternate turns in a local multiplayer setting.

Win Detection Logic: Automatically checks for four connected discs in all directions after each move.

Graphical Interface: (If Windows Forms) The GUI allows intuitive click-based interaction for column selection and displays the game grid in real-time.

Draw Handling: Recognizes and displays a message when the board is full without a winner.

Restart Option: Players can reset the game to play again.

Technologies Used:

Language: C#

Framework: .NET Framework or .NET Core

Development Tool: Visual Studio

UI: Windows Forms (or console-based UI)

Learning Objectives:

Practice with C# syntax and logic structures

Gain experience in event-driven programming

Understand state management in interactive applications

Improve debugging and testing skills in a game environment

Possible Improvements:

Add a single-player mode with basic AI logic

Track and display player scores across multiple games

Implement animations for disc drops

Add a timer to limit player turns

This project serves as a great introduction to game development in C# and demonstrates the practical application of programming concepts in a fun and engaging way.
